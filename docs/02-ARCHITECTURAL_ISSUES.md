# üö® Critical Architectural Issues & Solutions

## üö® **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **‚ùå Database Design Problems**

**Current State:** The database is being populated with too many tasks immediately, which is not optimal for the application's purpose.

**Issues Identified:**

- [ ] ‚ùå **Over-population**: Too many tasks created at once
- [ ] ‚ùå **Poor User Experience**: Users overwhelmed with tasks they didn't create
- [ ] ‚ùå **Inefficient Storage**: Tasks created before user needs them
- [ ] ‚ùå **No Personalization**: Tasks not tailored to user's specific home

**Proposed Solution:**

- [ ] ‚úÖ **Template-based System**: Store only task templates, not instances
- [ ] ‚úÖ **On-Demand Creation**: Create task instances only when user completes a task
- [ ] ‚úÖ **Repetitive Task Logic**: When user marks task as complete, create next instance automatically
- [ ] ‚úÖ **User Control**: Let users decide which tasks to add/remove

## ü§ñ **AI-POWERED TASK GENERATION (NEW FEATURE)**

**Vision:** The application should facilitate task creation, not require manual creation.

**Core Features Needed:**

- [ ] ü§ñ **AI Interview System**: Guided questions about user's home
- [ ] ü§ñ **Smart Task Generation**: AI creates personalized cleaning tasks
- [ ] ü§ñ **Frequency Recommendations**: AI suggests optimal cleaning frequencies
- [ ] ü§ñ **Importance Explanations**: AI explains why each task is important

**Implementation Requirements:**

### **1. AI Interview Flow**

```typescript
interface HomeAssessment {
  homeType: "apartment" | "house" | "studio";
  rooms: Room[];
  pets: boolean;
  children: boolean;
  allergies: boolean;
  lifestyle: "busy" | "moderate" | "relaxed";
  cleaningPreferences: "minimal" | "standard" | "thorough";
}
```

### **2. AI Task Generation**

- [ ] ü§ñ **OpenAI Integration**: Use GPT-4 for intelligent task creation
- [ ] ü§ñ **Professional Sanitation Expert**: AI acts as cleaning professional
- [ ] ü§ñ **Evidence-Based Recommendations**: Include scientific sources
- [ ] ü§ñ **Friendly Explanations**: User-friendly language with expert backing

### **3. Educational Content**

```typescript
interface TaskExplanation {
  task: string;
  frequency: string;
  importance: string;
  healthImpact: string;
  scientificSource: string;
  sourceUrl: string;
  friendlyExplanation: string;
}
```

**Example AI Response:**

> "**Floor Cleaning - Every 4 days** üßπ
>
> _Why this frequency?_ Regular floor cleaning prevents the buildup of allergens, dust mites, and bacteria that can cause respiratory issues. According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, floors should be cleaned at least twice a week to maintain healthy indoor air quality.
>
> _Health Impact:_ Dirty floors can harbor up to 400,000 bacteria per square inch, including E. coli and staphylococcus, which can cause infections and worsen allergies.

## üìä **NEW DATABASE SCHEMA (GAMIFIED)**

### **Current Schema (Problematic):**

```sql
-- Too many task instances created upfront
CREATE TABLE task_instances (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  task_name TEXT,
  due_date DATE,
  completed BOOLEAN,
  -- ... many instances per user
);
```

### **New Gamified Schema (Optimized):**

```sql
-- User profiles with gamification
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  level INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  experience_points INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  coins INTEGER DEFAULT 100,
  gems INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
  streak_days INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Cleaning tools inventory
CREATE TABLE user_tools (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  tool_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  current_durability INTEGER,
  max_durability INTEGER,
  uses_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Home areas with health tracking
CREATE TABLE home_areas (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  area_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  current_health INTEGER DEFAULT 100,
  max_health INTEGER DEFAULT 100
);

-- Task templates (language-specific)
CREATE TABLE task_templates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  template_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- References JSON files
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  exp_reward INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  area_health_impact INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  language TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (language IN ('en', 'es'))
);

-- Task instances with gamification
CREATE TABLE task_instances (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_task_id UUID REFERENCES user_tasks(id),
  due_date DATE,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  exp_earned INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  area_health_restored INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  tools_used JSONB DEFAULT '[]'
);
```
