## 🎯 **Gamification Mechanics**

#### **A. Experience System**

```typescript
// Level calculation: level = floor(sqrt(exp / 100)) + 1
// EXP needed for next level: (level * level) * 100
// Example: Level 1 → 2: 400 EXP, Level 2 → 3: 900 EXP
```

#### **B. Tool Durability**

```typescript
// Tools lose durability per use
// Maintenance extends tool life
// Replacement when durability reaches 0
// Different tools have different wear rates
```

#### **C. Area Health**

```typescript
// Areas start at 100% health
// Health decays over time (1-2% per day)
// Tasks restore health based on importance
// Visual indicators: Green (80-100%), Yellow (40-79%), Red (0-39%)
```

## 🔧 **Task Modification System (3 Options)**

#### **Scenario Example:**

_User has "Sweep Floors" every 4 days, but wants to modify the task on Week 3_

#### **Option 1: Modify Single Instance Only** 🎯

- **Action**: Create a one-time override for that specific date
- **Behavior**:
  - Original pattern continues unchanged
  - New "override" task created for specific date
  - No impact on future occurrences
- **Use Case**: "I want to sweep tomorrow instead of the scheduled day"
- **Database**: Creates `task_instance_override` record

#### **Option 2: Modify All Future Instances** 🔄

- **Action**: Change the pattern starting from that date
- **Behavior**:
  - Updates `user_tasks.custom_frequency_days`
  - All future instances follow new pattern
  - Past instances remain unchanged
- **Use Case**: "I want to sweep every 3 days instead of 4 from now on"
- **Database**: Updates `user_tasks` record

#### **Option 3: Modify All Instances (Past & Future)** ⚡

- **Action**: Complete pattern reset
- **Behavior**:
  - Updates base frequency for all instances
  - Recalculates all past and future dates
  - Complete pattern overhaul
- **Use Case**: "I want to change this to a weekly task completely"
- **Database**: Updates `user_tasks` + recalculates all instances
